# Library (React App)

Demo: http://niravtech.com/projects/react/library/

Basic e-book library management application built using React. One can mark the book as read or delete the book. This will save the selection into the local storage of the browser so doing a browser data wipe will get rid of any saved settings.

There is a feature to add a book into the library and most of it works except adding a custom book cover. For security purposes I haven't allowed that for the public.
